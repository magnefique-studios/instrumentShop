# Validation Criteria

## Success Criteria for Migration

### Per-Module Validation

Each module upgrade is considered successful when:

1. **Build Success**: Module compiles without errors using `mvn clean package`
2. **Health Check**: `/healthcheck` endpoint returns HTTP 200
3. **Functional Equivalence**: All REST endpoints return the same response structure as pre-migration
4. **No javax References**: No remaining `javax.persistence`, `javax.annotation`, or `javax.validation` imports (for modules migrating to Spring Boot 3.x)
5. **No Deprecated APIs**: No usage of deprecated Spring Boot APIs
6. **Docker Deployment**: Service starts and passes health check in Docker Compose environment
